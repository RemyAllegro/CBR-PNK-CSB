# CBR+PNK for FoundryVTT
This is my implementation of the [CBR+PNK](https://emanoelmelo.itch.io/cbrpnk-core) system by Emanoel Melo for use with [Custom System Builder](https://gitlab.com/custom-system-builder/custom-system-builder) for FoundryVTT 

# Other Implementation
Shout out to Kiszu for his implementation of [CBR+PNK for Foundry](https://github.com/P4NTY/CBR-PNK-FOUNDRY)

# Usage 
1. Create a world with Custom System Builder (manifest url: https://gitlab.com/custom-system-builder/custom-system-builder/-/raw/main/system.json)
2. Import the provided export.json file via the "Import templates JSON" option
3. Link to the style.css file in the game settings for custom system builder* 
4. Add the MonoRegular font in the game settings for Core, using the Font Family name "Mono"*
5. Add the cbrpnk_icons font in the game settings for Core, using the Font Family name "cbrpnk"*
6. In order to use sheet automation, install and enable the CBR+PNK Roller module (manifest url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RemyAllegro/foundryvtt-cbrpnkroller/main/module.json)
